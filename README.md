# Implement-Research-paper-VERY-DEEP-CONVOLUTIONAL-NETWORKS-FOR-LARGE-SCALE-IMAGE-RECOGNITION
Contribution : Evaluation of deep neural network with depth of 16-19 weight layers and very small (3 * 3) convolution filters.
# Architecture :
Pre-processing : Substracting RGB mean value from each value.
Convolution filters : (3*3 ) and (1*1). : Describes why we need to chooses smaller sized filter.
